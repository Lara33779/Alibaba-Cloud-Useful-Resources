In this article, we will introduce the neural networks which can be applied to natural language processing (NLP).

Researchers increasingly leverage deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs to enhance natural language processing (NLP) tasks, focusing on word, sentence, and article representations. Word embeddings capture semantic and grammatical information, while sentence and article representations are achieved through deep neural network models, supporting applications like machine translation and sentiment analysis. In question-answering (QA) systems, CNNs and RNNs enable accurate question classification and answer selection by creating sentence representation vectors. Platforms like Alibaba Cloud’s Machine Learning Platform for AI and Machine Translation service utilize these advancements to drive seamless language processing and translation solutions.
