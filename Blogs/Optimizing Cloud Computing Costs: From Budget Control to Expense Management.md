At the Apsara Conference 2020, Alibaba Cloud launched a Savings Plan to help customers optimize computing costs. This plan allows the pre-purchase of cloud resources with pay-as-you-go flexibility, offering lower costs than pay-as-you-go but higher than annual or monthly rates. It includes General and Compute-Optimized types, with All-Prepaid, Partial-Prepaid, and No-Prepaid payment options, the first offering the highest discount. The plan supports installment payments and is ideal for managing cash flow. For stable services, choose lower commitment hours, and for flexible needs, stick with pay-as-you-go. ECI users should use the General type for cloud-native cost optimization.

Since COVID-19, the shift to digitalization has made cloud computing essential. Alibaba Cloud, a leader in cloud-native technology, achieved a full upgrade by 2021, leveraging the world's largest Kubernetes cluster to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Despite advances in cloud-native technologies, businesses face planning, billing, and optimization challenges. The emerging field of cloud-native FinOps, combining FinOps principles with cloud-native tech, helps companies manage finances and predict costs. Alibaba Cloud’s cloud-native FinOps solution offers advanced cost allocation, insights, and optimization for multi-cloud and hybrid environments, driving efficient resource use and accelerating cloud-native adoption.

[**Budget and Cost Management**](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/well-architected/latest/budget-and-cost-management?utm_content=g_1000397284)

Effective cloud budget management involves setting expense, usage-based, and usage rate/coverage rate budgets to control spending. Expense budgets target financial units and products, usage-based budgets align with business needs, and usage rate/coverage rate budgets manage savings plans and reserved instance coupons. Accurate cost allocation is crucial, starting with shared expenses assigned to a common unit and then distributed to target units.

This guide explains how to monitor resource consumption, optimize usage, and minimize costs on Alibaba Cloud. Key Billing Details and Usage Records: Accessible through the Alibaba Cloud Management Console, these provide insights into bill specifics and 24-hour resource usage, including SQL statement complexity, storage, and download traffic.

[**Checking Up on Costs: Saving More with Cloud Computing**](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/595130?utm_content=g_1000397286)

Effective cloud expenditure management is vital for financial control. Alibaba Cloud provides tools to track spending through the management console, with regular billing reviews and weekly account checks. Optimize storage costs by releasing unused pay-as-you-go servers and using cheaper storage modes for infrequent OSS buckets, potentially saving up to 75%. Utilize CloudMonitor to manage compute resources, monitor server performance, and receive alerts for issues like low disk space, all at no additional cost. Quarterly audits ensure your cloud resources are up-to-date and aligned with business needs. Stay informed about Alibaba Cloud's new offerings for efficiency and cost savings.

The Cloud Cost Requirement Analysis highlights the need to understand cloud cost factors for effective planning. Key areas include selecting cloud regions based on proximity to IDCs or customers, compliance with regulations and internal standards, and robust security measures like MFA and firewalls. Ensuring business continuity involves defining SLAs, RTOs, and RPOs, which may increase costs for multi-region hosting. Choosing the right instance and billing modes, designing elastic architectures, and managing technical teams with support plans and training are essential. Automation and standardization enhance resource provisioning and deployment efficiency.

Shanlie, with 13 years in IT, explores microservices' benefits and challenges in large-scale systems. Microservices enhance development and flexibility, accelerate evolution, and address performance bottlenecks but add architectural complexity. Kubernetes and Docker help manage these complexities and improve scaling. However, traditional scaling methods struggle during traffic spikes. Serverless architectures optimize resource use by eliminating server management, potentially lowering costs and enhancing responsiveness, though microservices often face low resource utilization, emphasizing the need for efficient management strategies.

[**Budget management｜Hologres**](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/hologres/user-guide/budget-management?utm_content=g_1000397289)

Hologres Shared Cluster instances on Alibaba Cloud provide budget management through the Expenses and Costs console, crucial for monitoring and optimizing costs associated with the flexible pay-per-byte billing method. Users can set budgets, receive alerts for threshold breaches, and perform comparative analyses. Alerts are based on daily bills generated the next day and do not affect job execution. To set up, log into the console, go to 'Cost Management > Budget Management', and create a budget by defining parameters like name, scope, cycle, and amount. Configure alerts for actual costs with specific thresholds and notification methods before submitting for implementation.
